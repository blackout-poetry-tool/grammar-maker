Stars wheel in purple, yours is not so rare
as Hesperus, nor yet so great a star
as bright Aldeboran or Sirius,
nor yet the stained and brilliant one of War
stars turn in purple, glorious to the sight
yours is not gracious as the Pleiads are
nor as Orion's sapphires, luminous
yet disenchanted, cold, imperious face,
when all the others blighted, reel and fall,
your star, steel-set, keeps lone and frigid tryst
to freighted ships, baffled in wind and blast.
I should have thought
in a dream you would have brought
some lovely, perilous thing,
orchids piled in a great sheath,
as who would say in a dream,
"I send you this,
who left the blue veins
of your throat unkissed."
Why was it that your hands
that never took mine,
your hands that I could see
drift over the orchid-heads
so carefully,
your hands, so fragile, sure to lift
so gently, the fragile flower-stuff
ah, ah, how was it
You never sent in a dream
the very form, the very scent,
not heavy, not sensuous,
but perilousperilous
of orchids, piled in a great sheath,
and folded underneath on a bright scroll,
some word
"Flower sent to flower
for white hands, the lesser white,
less lovely of flower-leaf,"
"Lover to lover, no kiss,
no touch, but forever and ever this."
Will you glimmer on the sea?	
Will you fling your spear-head	
On the shore?	
What note shall we pitch?	
We have a song,	        
On the bank we share our arrows 	
The loosed string tells our note	
O flight,	
Bring her swiftly to our song.	
She is great,	        
We measure her by the pine-trees.
You are as gold 
as the half-ripe grain 
that merges to gold again, 
as white as the white rain 
that beats through 
the half-opened flowers 
of the great flower tufts 
thick on the black limbs 
of an Illyrian apple bough.
Can honey distill such fragrance 
As your bright hair
For your face is as fair as rain, 
yet as rain that lies clear 
on white honey-comb,
lends radiance to the white wax, 
so your hair on your brow 
casts light for a shadow.
White, O white face
from disenchanted days 
wither alike dark rose 
and fiery bays 
no gift within our hands,
nor strength to praise, 
only defeat and silence 
though we lift hands, disenchanted, 
of small strength, nor raise 
branch of the laurel 
or the light of torch, 
but fold the garment 
on the riven locks, 
yet hear, all-merciful, and touch 
the fore-head, dim, unlit of pride and thought,
Mistress–be near!
Give back the glamour to our will, 
the thought give back the tool, 
the chisel once we wrought 
things not unworthy, 
sandal and steel-clasp 
silver and steel, the coat 
with white leaf-pattern 
at the arm and throat 
silver and metal, hammered for the ridge 
of shield and helmet-rim 
white silver with the darker hammered in, 
belt, staff and magic spear-shaft 
with the gilt spark at the point and hilt.
Thou art come at length
More beautiful
Than any cool god
In a chamber under
Lycia's far coast,
Than any high god
Who touches us not
Here in the seeded grass.
Aye, than Argestes
Scattering the broken leaves.
Silver dust
lifted from the earth,
higher than my arms reach, 
you have mounted.
O silver,
higher than my arms reach 
you front us with great mass 
no flower ever opened
so staunch a white leaf
no flower ever parted silver
from such rare silver
O white pear,
your flower-tufts,
thick on the branch,  
bring summer and ripe fruits
in their purple hearts.
O be swift 
we have always known you wanted us.
We fled inland with our flocks.
we pastured them in hollows,
cut off from the wind
and the salt track of the marsh.
We worshipped inland 
we stepped past wood-flowers,
we forgot your tang,
we brushed wood-grass.
We wandered from pine-hills
through oak and scrub-oak tangles,
we broke hyssop and bramble,
we caught flower and new bramble-fruit
in our hair we laughed
as each branch whipped back,
we tore our feet in half-buried rocks
and knotted roots and acorn-cups.
We forgot we worshipped,
we parted green from green,
we sought further thickets,
we dipped our ankles
through leaf-mould and earth,
and wood and wood-bank enchanted us 
and the feel of the clefts in the bark,
and the slope between tree and tree 
and a slender path strung field to field
and wood to wood
and hill to hill
and the forest after it.
We forgot for a moment
tree-resin, tree-bark,
sweat of a torn branch
were sweet to taste.
We were enchanted with the fields,
the tufts of coarse grass
in the shorter grass
we loved all this.
But now, our boat climbs hesitates drops
climbs hesitates crawls back
climbs hesitates
O, be swift
we have always known you wanted us.
Rose, harsh rose,
marred and with stint of petals,
meagre flower, thin,
sparse of leaf,
more precious
than a wet rose
single on a stem 
you are caught in the drift.
Stunted, with small leaf,
you are flung on the sand,
you are lifted
in the crisp sand
that drives in the wind.
Can the spice-rose
drip such acrid fragrance
hardened in a leaf?
Let her who walks in Paphos
take the glass,
let Paphos take the mirror
and the work of frosted fruit,
gold apples set
with silver apple-leaf,
white leaf of silver
wrought with vein of gilt.
Let Paphos lift the mirror
let her look
into the polished center of the disk.
Let Paphos take the mirror
did she press
flowerlet of flame-flower
to the lustrous white
of the white forehead?
did the dark veins beat
a deeper purple
than the wine-deep tint
of the dark flower?
Did she deck black hair,
one evening, with the winter-white
flower of the winter-berry?
Did she look reft of her lover
at a face gone white
under the chaplet
of white virgin-breath?
Lais, exultant, tyrannizing Greece,
Lais who kept her lovers in the porch,
lover on lover waiting
but to creep
where the robe brushed the threshold
where still sleeps Lais,
so she creeps, Lais,
to lay her mirror at the feet
of her who reigns in Paphos.
Lais has left her mirror,
for she sees no longer in its depth
the Lais' self
that laughed exultant,
tyrannizing Greece.
Lais has left her mirror,
for she weeps no longer,
finding in its depth
a face, but other
than dark flame and white
feature of perfect marble.
Lais has left her mirror
so one wrote
to her who reigns in Paphos
Lais who laughed a tyrant over Greece,
Lais who turned the lovers from the porch,
that swarm for whom now
Lais has no use
Lais is now no lover of the glass,
seeing no more the face as once it was,
wishing to see that face and finding this.
Are you alive?
I touch you.
You quiver like a sea-fish.
I cover you with my net.
What are you banded one?
Whiter
than the crust
left by the tide,
we are stung by the hurled sand
and the broken shells.
We no longer sleep
in the wind 
we awoke and fled
through the city gate.
Tear 
tear us an altar,
tug at the cliff-boulders,
pile them with the rough stones 
we no longer
sleep in the wind,
propitiate us.
Chant in a wail
that never halts,
pace a circle and pay tribute
with a song.
When the roar of a dropped wave
breaks into it,
pour meted words
of sea-hawks and gull
sand sea-birds that cry
discords.
What do I care
that the stream is trampled,
the sand on the stream-bank
still holds the print of your foot
the heel is cut deep.
I see another mark
on the grass ridge of the bank
it points toward the wood-path.
I have lost the third
in the packed earth.
But here
a wild-hyacinth stalk is snapped
the purple buds half ripe
show deep purple
where your heel pressed.
A patch of flowering grass,
low, trailing
you brushed this
the green stems show yellow-green
where you lifted turned the earth-side
to the light
this and a dead leaf-spine,
split across,
show where you passed.
You were swift, swift!
here the forest ledge slopes,
rain has furrowed the roots.
Your hand caught at this
the root snapped under your weight.
I can almost follow the note
where it touched this slender tree
and the next answered,
and the next.
And you climbed yet further!
you stopped by the dwarf-cornel,
whirled on your heels,
doubled on your track.
This is clear,
you fell on the downward slope,
you dragged a bruised thigh, you limped,
you clutched this larch.
Did your head, bent back,
search further,
clear through the green leaf-moss
of the larch branches?
Did you clutch,
stammer with short breath and gasp
wood-daemons grant life,
give life, I am almost lost.
For some wood-daemon
has lightened your steps.
I can find no trace of you
in the larch-cones and the underbrush.
Amber husk
fluted with gold,
fruit on the sand
marked with a rich grain,
treasure
spilled near the shrub-pines
to bleach on the boulders
your stalk has caught root
among wet pebbles
and drift flung by the sea
and grated shells
and split conch-shells.
Beautiful, wide-spread,
fire upon leaf,
what meadow yields
so fragrant a leaf
as your bright leaf?
The light passes
from ridge to ridge,
from flower to flower
the hepaticas, wide-spread
under the light
grow faint
the petals reach inward,
the blue tips bend
toward the bluer heart
and the flowers are lost.
The cornel-buds are still white,
but shadows dart
from the cornel-roots
black creeps from root to root,
each leaf
cuts another leaf on the grass,
shadow seeks shadow,
then both leaf
and leaf-shadow are lost.
The white violet
is scented on its stalk,
the sea-violet
fragile as agate,
lies fronting all the wind
among the torn shells
on the sand-bank.
The greater blue violets
flutter on the hill,
but who would change for these
who would change for these
one root of the white sort?
Violet
your grasp is frail
on the edge of the sand-hill,
but you catch the light
frost, a star edges with its fire.
The light beats upon me.
I am startled,
a split leaf crackles on the paved floor,
I am anguished, defeated.
A slight wind shakes the seed-pods,
my thoughts are spent
as the black seeds.
My thoughts tear me,
I dread their fever.
I am scattered in its whirl.
I am scattered like
the hot shrivelled seeds.
The shrivelled seeds
are spilt on the path,
the grass bends with dust,
the grape slips
under its crackled leaf
yet far beyond the spent seed-pods,
and the blackened stalks of mint,
the poplar is bright on the hill,
the poplar spreads out,
deep-rooted among trees.
O poplar, you are great
among the hill-stones,
while I perish on the path
among the crevices of the rocks.
Reed,
slashed and torn
but doubly rich, 
such great heads as yours
drift upon temple-steps,
but you are shattered
in the wind.
Myrtle-bark
is flecked from you,
scales are dashed
from your stem,
sand cuts your petal,
furrows it with hard edge,
like flint
on a bright stone.
Yet though the whole wind
slash at your bark,
you are lifted up,
aye, though it hiss
to cover you with froth.
The hard sand breaks,
And the grains of it
Are clear as wine.
Far off over the leagues of it,
The wind,
Playing on the wide shore,
Piles little ridges,
And the great waves
Break over it.
But more than the many-foamed ways
Of the sea,
I know him
Of the triple path-ways,
Hermes,
Who awaiteth.
Dubious,
Facing three ways,
Welcoming wayfarers,
He whom the sea-orchard
Shelters from the west,
From the east
Weathers sea-wind
Fronts the great dunes.
Wind rushes
Over the dunes,
And the coarse, salt-crusted grass
Answers.
It whips round my ankles!
Small is
This white stream,
Flowing below ground
From the poplar-shaded hill,
But the water is sweet.
Apples on the small trees
Are hard,
Too small,
Too late ripened
By a desperate sun
That struggles through sea-mist.
The boughs of the trees
Are twisted
By many bafflings
Twisted are
The small-leafed boughs.
But the shadow of them
Is not the shadow of the mast head
Nor of the torn sails.
Hermes, Hermes,
The great sea foamed,
Gnashed its teeth about me
But you have waited,
Where sea-grass tangles with
Shore-grass.
Crash on crash of the sea,
straining to wreck men sea-boards, continents,
raging against the world, furious,
stay at last, for against your fury
and your mad fight,
the line of heroes stands, godlike
Akroneos, Oknolos, Elatreus,
helm-of-boat, loosener-of-helm, dweller-by-sea,
Nauteus, sea-man,
Prumneos, stern-of-ship,
Agchialos, sea-girt,
Elatreus, oar-shaft
lover-of-the-sea, lover-of-the-sea-ebb,
lover-of-the-swift-sea,
Ponteus, Proreus, Oöos
Anabesneos, who breaks to anger
as a wave to froth
Amphiolos, one caught between
wave-shock and wave-shock
Eurualos, broad sea-wrack,
like Ares, man’s death,
and Naubolidos, best in shape,
of all first in size
Phaekous, sea’s thunderbolt, 
ah, crash on crash of great names, 
man-tamer, man’s-help, perfect Laodamos
and last the songs of great Alkinöos,
Laodamos, Halios, and god-like Clytomeos.
Of all nations, of all cities,
of all continents,
she is favoured above the rest,
for she gives men as great as the sea,
to battle against the elements and evil
greater even than the sea,
they live beyond wrack and death of cities,
and each god-like name spoken
is as a shrine in a godless place.
But to name you,
we, reverent, are breathless,
weak with pain and old loss,
and exile and despair, 
our hearts break but to speak
your name, Oknaleos, 
and may we but call you in the feverish wrack
of our storm-strewn beach, Eretmeos,
our hurt is quiet and our hearts tamed,
as the sea may yet be tamed,
and we vow to float great ships,
named for each hero,
and oar-blades, cut of mountain-trees
as such men might have shaped
Eretmeos, and the sea is swept,
baffled by the lordly shape,
Akroneos has pines for his ship’s keel
to love, to mate the sea?
Ah there is Ponteos,
the very deeps roar,
hailing you dear
they clamour to Ponteos,
and to Proëos
leap, swift to kiss, to curl, to creep,
lover to mistress.
What wave, what love, what foam,
For Oöos who moves swift as the sea?
Ah stay, my heart, the weight
of lovers, of loneliness
drowns me,
alas that their very names
so press to break my heart
with heart-sick weariness,
what would they be,
the very gods,
rearing their mighty length
beside the unharvested sea?
I have had enough.
I gasp for breath.
Every way ends, every road,
every foot-path leads at last
to the hill-crest, 
then you retrace your steps,
or find the same slope on the other side,
precipitate.
I have had enough, 
border-pinks, clove-pinks, wax-lilies,
herbs, sweet-cress.
O for some sharp swish of a branch, 
there is no scent of resin
in this place,
no taste of bark, of coarse weeds,
aromatic, astringent, 
only border on border of scented pinks.
Have you seen fruit under cover
that wanted light, 
pears wadded in cloth,
protected from the frost,
melons, almost ripe,
smothered in straw?
Why not let the pears cling
to the empty branch?
All your coaxing will only make
a bitter fruit, 
let them cling, ripen of themselves,
test their own worth,
nipped, shrivelled by the frost,
to fall at last but fair
With a russet coat.
Or the melon, 
let it bleach yellow
in the winter light,
even tart to the taste, 
it is better to taste of frost, 
the exquisite frost, 
than of wadding and of dead grass.
For this beauty,
beauty without strength,
chokes out life.
I want wind to break,
scatter these pink-stalks,
snap off their spiced heads,
fling them about with dead leaves, 
spread the paths with twigs,
limbs broken off,
trail great pine branches,
hurled from some far wood
right across the melon-patch,
break pear and quince, 
leave half-trees, torn, twisted
but showing the fight was valiant.
O to blot out this garden
to forget, to find a new beauty
in some terrible
wind-tortured place.
Where the slow river
meets the tide,
a red swan lifts red wings
and darker beak,
and underneath the purple down
of his soft breast
uncurls his coral feet.
Through the deep purple
of the dying heat
of sun and mist,
the level ray of sun-beam
has caressed
the lily with dark breast,
and flecked with richer gold
its golden crest.
Where the slow lifting
of the tide,
floats into the river
and slowly drifts
among the reeds,
and lifts the yellow flags,
he floats
where tide and river meet.
Ah kingly kiss
no more regret
nor old deep memories
to mar the bliss
where the low sedge is thick,
the gold day-lily
outspreads and rests
beneath soft fluttering
of red swan wings
and the warm quivering
of the red swan’s breast.
nstead of pearls
a wrought clasp
a bracelet
will you accept this?
You know the script
you will start, wonder
what is left, what phrase
after last night? This
The world is yet unspoiled for you,
you wait, expectant
you are like the children
who haunt your own steps
for chance bits
a comb
that may have slipped,
a gold tassel, unravelled,
plucked from your scarf,
twirled by your slight fingers
into the street
a flower dropped.
Do not think me unaware,
I who have snatched at you
as the street-child clutched
at the seed-pearls you spilt
that hot day
when your necklace snapped.
Do not dream that I speak
as one defrauded of delight,
sick, shaken by each heart-beat
or paralyzed, stretched at length,
who gasps
these ripe pears
are bitter to the taste,
this spiced wine, poison, corrupt.
I cannot walk
who would walk?
Life is a scavenger's pit
I escape
I only, rejecting it,
lying here on this couch.
Your garden sloped to the beach,
myrtle overran the paths,
honey and amber flecked each leaf,
the citron-lily head
one among many
weighed there, over-sweet.
The myrrh-hyacinth
spread across low slopes,
violets streaked black ridges
through the grass.
The house, too, was like this,
over painted, over lovely
the world is like this.
Sleepless nights,
I remember the initiates,
their gesture, their calm glance.
I have heard how in rapt thought,
in vision, they speak
with another race,
more beautiful, more intense than this.
I could laugh
more beautiful, more intense?
Perhaps that other life
is contrast always to this.
I reason
I have lived as they
in their inmost rites
they endure the tense nerves
through the moment of ritual.
I endure from moment to moment
days pass all alike,
tortured, intense.
This I forgot last night
you must not be blamed,
it is not your fault
as a child, a flower
any flower
tore my breast
meadow-chicory, a common grass-tip,
a leaf shadow, a flower tint
unexpected on a winter-branch.
I reason
another life holds what this lacks,
a sea, unmoving, quie
not forcing our strength
to rise to it, beat on beat
stretch of sand,
no garden beyond, strangling
with its myrrh-lilies
a hill, not set with black violets
but stones, stones, bare rocks,
dwarf-trees, twisted, no beauty
to distract
to crowd
madness upon madness.
Only a still place
and perhaps some outer horror
some hideousness to stamp beauty,
a mark
no changing it now
on our hearts.
I send no string of pearls,
no bracelet
accept this.
The sea called
you faced the estuary,
you were drowned as the tide passed.
I am glad of this
at least you have escaped.
The heavy sea-mist stifles me.
I choke with each breath
a curious peril, this
the gods have invented
curious torture for us.
One of us, pierced in the flank,
dragged himself across the marsh,
he tore at the bay-roots,
lost hold on the crumbling bank
Another crawledtoo late
for shelter under the cliffs.
I am glad the tide swept you out,
O beloved,
you of all this ghastly host
alone untouched,
your white flesh covered with salt
as with myrrh and burnt iris.
We were hemmed in this place,
so few of us, so few of us to fight
their sure lances,
the straight thrusteffortless
with slight life of muscle and shoulder.
So straightonly we were left,
the four of ussomehow shut off.
And the marsh dragged one back,
and another perished under the cliff,
and the tide swept you out.
Your feet cut steel on the paths,
I followed for the strength
of life and grasp.
I have seen beautiful feet
but never beauty welded with strength.
I marvelled at your height.
You stood almost level
with the lance-bearers
and so slight.
And I wondered as you clasped
your shoulder-strap
at the strength of your wrist
and the turn of your young fingers,
and the lift of your shorn locks,
and the bronze
of your sun-burnt neck.
All of this,
and the curious knee-cap,
fitted above the wrought greaves,
and the sharp muscles of your back
which the tunic could not cover
the outline
no garment could deface.
I wonder if you knew how I watched,
how I crowded before the spearsmen
but the gods wanted you,
the gods wanted you back.
Come, blunt your spear with us,
our pace is hot
and our bare heels
in the heel-prints, 
we stand tense, do you see, 
are you already beaten
by the chase?
We lead the pace
for the wind on the hills,
the low hill is spattered
with loose earth, 
our feet cut into the crust
as with spears.
We climbed the ploughed land,
dragged the seed from the clefts,
broke the clods with our heels,
whirled with a parched cry
into the woods
Can you come,
can you come,
can you follow the hound trail,
can you trample the hot froth?
Spring up, sway forward, 
follow the quickest one,
aye, though you leave the trail
and drop exhausted at our feet.
You are clear
O rose, cut in rock,
hard as the descent of hail.
I could scrape the colour
from the petals
like spilt dye from a rock.
If I could break you
I could break a tree.
If I could stir
I could break a tree, 
I could break you.
O wind, rend open the heat,
cut apart the heat,
rend it to tatters.
Fruit cannot drop
through this thick air, 
fruit cannot fall into heat
that presses up and blunts
the points of pears
and rounds the grapes.
Cut the heat, 
plough through it,
turning it on either side
of your path.
Great, bright portal,
shelf of rock,
rocks fitted in long ledges,
rocks fitted to dark, to silver granite,
to lighter rock, 
clean cut, white against white.
High, high, and no hill-goat
tramples, no mountain-sheep
has set foot on your fine grass
you lift, you are the world-edge,
pillar for the sky-arch.
The world heaved, 
we are next to the sky
over us, sea-hawks shout,
gulls sweep past, 
the terrible breakers are silent
from this place.
Below us, on the rock-edge,
where earth is caught in the fissures
of the jagged cliff,
a small tree stiffens in the gale,
it bends, but its white flowers
are fragrant at this height.
And under and under,
the wind booms
it whistles, it thunders,
it growls, it presses the grass
beneath its great feet.
I said
for ever and for ever, must I follow you
through the stones?
I catch at you, you lurch
you are quicker than my hand-grasp.
I wondered at you.
I shouted, dear, mysterious, beautiful, 
white myrtle-flesh.
I was splintered and torn
the hill-path mounted
swifter than my feet.
Could a daemon avenge this hurt,
I would cry to him, could a ghost,
I would shout, O evil,
follow this god,
taunt him with his evil and his vice.
Shall I hurl myself from here,
shall I leap and be nearer you?
Shall I drop, beloved, beloved,
ankle against ankle?
Would you pity me, O white breast?
If I woke, would you pity me,
would our eyes meet?
Have you heard,
do you know how I climbed this rock?
My breath caught, I lurched forward, 
stumbled in the ground-myrtle.
Have you heard, O god seated on the cliff,
how far toward the ledges of your house,
how far I had to walk?
Over me the wind swirls.
I have stood on your portal
and I know, 
you are further than this,
still further on another cliff.
They say there is no hope, 
sand, drift, rocks, rubble of the sea, 
the broken hulk of a ship,
hung with shreds of rope,
pallid under the cracked pitch.
They say there is no hope
to conjure you, 
no whip of the tongue to anger you, 
no hate of words
you must rise to refute.
They say you are twisted by the sea,
you are cut apart
by wave-break upon wave-break,
that you are misshapen by the sharp rocks,
broken by the rasp and after-rasp.
That you are cut, torn, mangled,
torn by the stress and beat,
no stronger than the strips of sand
along your ragged beach.
But we bring violets,
great masses, single, sweet,
wood-violets, stream-violets,
violets from a wet marsh.
Violets in clumps from hills,
tufts with earth at the roots,
violets tugged from rocks,
blue violets, moss, cliff, river-violets.
Yellow violets' gold,
burnt with a rare tint, 
violets like red ash
among tufts of grass.
We bring deep-purple
bird-foot violets.
We bring the hyacinth-violet,
sweet, bare, chill to the touch, 
and violets whiter than the in-rush
of your own white surf.
For you will come,
you will yet haunt men in ships,
you will trail across the fringe of strait
and circle the jagged rocks.
You will trail across the rocks
and wash them with your salt,
you will curl between sand-hills, 
you will thunder along the cliff, 
break, retreat, get fresh strength, 
gather and pour weight upon the beach.
You will draw back,
and the ripple on the sand-shelf
will be witness of your track.
O privet-white, you will paint
the lintel of wet sand with froth.
You will bring myrrh-bark
and drift laurel-wood from hot coasts!
when you hurl high, high, 
we will answer with a shout.
For you will come,
you will come,
you will answer our taut hearts,
you will break the lie of men's thoughts,
and cherish and shelter us.
Bear me to Dictaeus,
and to the steep slopes
to the river Erymanthus.
I choose spray of dittany,
cyperum, frail of flower,
buds of myrrh,
all-healing herbs,
close pressed in calathes.
For she lies panting,
drawing sharp breath,
broken with harsh sobs,
she, Hyella,
whom no god pities.
Dryads
haunting the groves,
nereids
who dwell in wet caves,
for all the white leaves of olive-branch,
and early roses,
and ivy wreaths, woven gold berries,
which she once brought to your altars,
bear now ripe fruits from Arcadia,
and Assyrian wine
to shatter her fever.
The light of her face falls from its flower,
as a hyacinth,
hidden in a far valley,
perishes upon burnt grass.
Pales,
bring gifts,
bring your Phoenician stuffs,
and do you, fleet-footed nymphs,
bring offerings,
Illyrian iris,
and a branch of shrub,
and frail-headed poppies.
The night has cut
each from each
and curled the petals
back from the stalk
and under it in crisp rows
under at an unfaltering pace,
under till the rinds break,
back till each bent leaf
is parted from its stalk
under at a grave pace,
under till the leaves
are bent back
till they drop upon earth,
back till they are all broken.
O night,
you take the petals
of the roses in your hand,
but leave the stark core
of the rose
to perish on the branch.
You crash over the trees,
you crack the live branch
the branch is white,
the green crushed,
each leaf is rent like split wood.
You burden the trees
with black drops,
you swirl and crash
you have broken off a weighted leaf
in the wind,
it is hurled out,
whirls up and sinks,
a green stone.
The city is peopled
with spirits, not ghosts, O my love
Though they crowded between
and usurped the kiss of my mouth
their breath was your gift,
their beauty, your life.
Men, fires, feasts,
steps of temple, fore-stone, lintel,
step of white altar, fire and after-fire,
slaughter before,
fragment of burnt meat,
deep mystery, grapple of mind to reach
the tense thought,
power and wealth, purpose and prayer alike,
men, fires, feasts, temple steps, useless.
Useless to me who plant
wide feet on a mighty plinth,
useless to me who sit,
wide of shoulder, great of thigh,
heavy in gold, to press
gold back against solid back
of the marble seat
useless the dragons wrought on the arms,
useless the poppy-buds and the gold inset
of the spray of wheat.
Ah they have wrought me heavy
and great of limb, 
she is slender of waist,
slight of breast, made of many fashions
they have set her small feet
on many a plinth
she they have known,
she they have spoken with,
she they have smiled upon,
she they have caught
and flattered with praise and gifts.
But useless the flattery
of the mighty power
they have granted me
for I will not stay in her breast
the great of limb,
though perfect the shell they have
fashioned me, these men!
Do I sit in the market place, 
do I smile, does a noble brow
bend like the brow of Zeus, 
am I a spouse, his or any,
am I a woman, or goddess or queen,
to be met by a god with a smile, and left?
Do you ask for a scroll,
parchment, oracle, prophecy, precedent
do you ask for tablets marked with thought
or words cut deep on the marble surface,
do you seek measured utterance or the mystic trance?
Sleep on the stones of Delphi, 
dare the ledges of Pallas
but keep me foremost,
keep me before you, after you, with you,
never forget when you start
for the Delphic precipice,
never forget when you seek Pallas
and meet in thought
yourself drawn out from yourself
like the holy serpent,
never forget
in thought or mysterious trance, 
I am greatest and least.
Soft are the hands of Love,
soft, soft are his feet
you who have twined myrtle,
have you brought crocuses,
white as the inner
stript bark of the osier,
have you set
black crocus against the black
locks of another?
Of whom do I speak?
Many the children of gods
but first I take
Bromios, fostering prince,
lift from the ivy brake, a king.
Enough of the lightning,
enough of the tales that speak
of the death of the mother
strange tales of a shelter
brought to the unborn,
enough of tale, myth, mystery, precedent, 
a child lay on the earth asleep.
Soft are the hands of Love,
but what soft hands
clutched at the thorny ground,
scratched like a small white ferret
or foraging whippet or hound,
sought nourishment and found
only the crackling of ivy,
dead ivy leaf and the white
berry, food for a bird,
no food for this who sought,
bending small head in a fever,
whining with little breath.
Ah, small black head,
ah, the purple ivy bush,
ah, berries that shook and spilt
on the form beneath,
who begot you and left?
Though I begot no man child
all my days,
the child of my heart and spirit,
is the child the gods desert
alike and the mother in death, 
the unclaimed Dionysios.
What of her, 
mistress of Death?
Form of a golden wreath
were my hands that girt her head,
fingers that strove to meet,
and met where the whisps escaped
from the fillet, of tenderest gold,
small circlet and slim
were my fingers then.
Now they are wrought of iron
to wrest from earth
secrets strong to protect,
strong to keep back the winter
when winter tracks too soon
blanch the forest
strong to break dead things,
the young tree, drained of sap,
the old tree, ready to drop,
to lift from the rotting bed
of leaves, the old
crumbling pine tree stock,
to heap bole and knot of fir
and pine and resinous oak,
till fire shatter the dark
and hope of spring
rise in the hearts of men.
What of her, 
mistress of Death, 
what of his kiss?
Ah, strong were his arms to wrest
slight limbs from the beautiful earth,
young hands that plucked the first
buds of the chill narcissus,
soft fingers that broke
and fastened the thorny stalk
with the flower of wild acanthus.
Ah, strong were the arms that took
ah evil, the heart and graceless,
but the kiss was less passionate!
Drenched with purple,
drenched with dye, my wool,
bind you the wheel-spokes, 
turn, turn, turn my wheel!
Drenched with purple,
steeped in the red pulp
of bursting sea-sloes, 
turn, turn, turn my wheel!
Ah did he think
I did not know,
I did not feel, 
what wrack, what weal for him
golden one, golden one,
turn again Aphrodite with the yellow zone,
I am cursed, cursed, undone!
Ah and my face, Aphrodite,
beside your gold,
is cut out of white stone!
Laurel blossom and the red seed
of the red vervain weed,
burn, crackle in the fire,
burn, crackle for my need!
Laurel leaf, O fruited
branch of bay,
burn, burn away
thought, memory and hurt!
Ah when he comes,
stumbling across my sill,
will he find me still,
fragrant as the white privet,
or as a bone,
polished in wet and sun,
worried of wild beaks,
and of the whelps' teeth, 
worried of flesh,
left to bleach under the sun,
white as ash bled of heat,
white as hail blazing in sheet-lightning,
white as forked lightning
rending the sleet?
On the paved parapet
you will step carefully
from amber stones to onyx
flecked with violet,
mingled with light,
half showing the sea-grass
and sea-sand underneath,
reflecting your white feet
and the gay strap crimson
as lily-buds of Arion,
and the gold that binds your feet.
You will pass
beneath the island disk
and myrtle-wood,
the carved support of it
and the white stretch
of its white beach,
curved as the moon crescent
or ivory when some fine hand
chisels it
when the sun slips
through the far edge,
there is rare amber
through the sea,
and flecks of it
glitter on the dolphin's back
and jewelled halter
and harness and bit
as he sways under it.
Weed, moss-weed,
root tangled in sand,
sea-iris, brittle flower,
one petal like a shell
is broken,
and you print a shadow
like a thin twig.
Fortunate one,
scented and stinging,
rigid myrrh-bud,
camphor-flower,
sweet and salt, you are wind
in our nostrils.
Do the murex-fishers
drench you as they pass?
Do your roots drag up colour
from the sand?
Have they slipped gold under you, 
rivets of gold?
Band of iris-flowers
above the waves,
you are painted blue,
painted like a fresh prow
stained among the salt weeds.
It was easy enough
to bend them to my wish,
it was easy enough
to alter them with a touch,
but you
adrift on the great sea,
how shall I call you back?
Cedar and white ash,
rock-cedar and sand plants
and tamarisk
red cedar and white cedar
and black cedar from the inmost forest,
fragrance upon fragrance
and all of my sea-magic is for nought.
It was easy enough, 
a thought called them
from the sharp edges of the earth
they prayed for a touch,
they cried for the sight of my face,
they entreated me
till in pity
I turned each to his own self.
Panther and panther,
then a black leopard
follows close, 
black panther and red
and a great hound,
a god-like beast,
cut the sand in a clear ring
and shut me from the earth,
and cover the sea-sound
with their throats,
and the sea-roar with their own barks
and bellowing and snarls,
and the sea-stars
and the swirl of the sand,
and the rock-tamarisk
and the wind resonance, 
but not your voice.
It is easy enough to call men
from the edges of the earth.
It is easy enough to summon them to my feet
with a thought, 
it is beautiful to see the tall panther
and the sleek deer-hounds
circle in the dark.
It is easy enough
to make cedar and white ash fumes
into palaces
and to cover the sea-caves
with ivory and onyx.
But I would give up
rock-fringes of coral
and the inmost chamber
of my island palace
and my own gifts
and the whole region
of my power and magic
for your glance.
The cornel-trees
uplift from the furrows,
the roots at their bases
strike lower through the barley-sprays.
So arise and face me.
I am poisoned with the rage of song.
I once pierced the flesh
of the wild-deer,
now am I afraid to touch
the blue and the gold-veined hyacinths?
I will tear the full flowers
and the little heads
of the grape-hyacinths.
I will strip the life from the bulb
until the ivory layers
lie like narcissus petals
on the black earth.
Arise, 
lest I bend an ash-tree
into a taut bow, 
and slay, and tear
all the roots from the earth.
The cornel-wood blazes
and strikes through the barley-sprays,
but I have lost heart for this.
I break a staff.
I break the tough branch.
I know no light in the woods.
I have lost pace with the winds.
O wind, rend open the heat,
cut apart the heat,
rend it to tatters.
Fruit cannot drop
through this thick air, 
fruit cannot fall into heat
that presses up and blunts
the points of pears
and rounds the grapes
Cut the heat, 
plough through it,
turning it on either side
of your path.
It was easy enough
to bend them to my wish,
it was easy enough
to alter them with a touch,
but you
adrift on the great sea,
how shall I call you back?
Cedar and white ash,
rock-cedar and sand plants
and tamarisk
red cedar and white cedar
and black cedar from the inmost forest,
fragrance upon fragrance
and all of my sea-magic is for nought.

a thought called them
from the sharp edges of the earth
they prayed for a touch,

But I would give up

of my island palace
and my own gifts
and the whole region

for your glance.
It is strange that I should want
this sight of your face, 
we have had so much
at any moment now I may pass,
stand near the gate,
do not speak, 
only reach if you can, your face
half-fronting the passage
toward the light.
Fate, God sends this as a mark,
a last token that we are not forgot,
lost in this turmoil,
about to be crushed out,
burned or stamped out
at best with sudden death.
The spearsman who brings this
will ask for the gold clasp
you wear under your coat.
I gave all I had left.
Press close to the portal,
my gate will soon clang
and your fellow wretches
will crowd to the entrance, 
be first at the gate.
Ah beloved, do not speak.
I write this in great haste, 
do not speak,
you may yet be released.
I am glad enough to depart
though I have never tasted life
as in these last weeks.
It is a strange life,
patterned in fire and letters
on the prison pavement.
If I glance up
it is written on the walls,
it is cut on the floor,
it is patterned across
the slope of the roof.
I am weak, weak, 
last night if the guard
had left the gate unlocked
I could not have ventured to escape,
but one thought serves me now
with strength.
As I pass down the corridor
past desperate faces at each cell,
your eyes and my eyes may meet.
You will be dark, unkempt,
but I pray for one glimpse of your face, 
why do I want this?
I who have seen you at the banquet
each flower of your hyacinth-circlet
white against your hair.
Why do I want this,
when even last night
you startled me from sleep?
You stood against the dark rock,
you grasped an elder staff.
So many nights
you have distracted me from terror.
Once you lifted a spear-flower.
I remember how you stooped
to gather it, 
and it flamed, the leaf and shoot
and the threads, yellow, yellow, 
sheer till they burnt
to red-purple in the cup.
As I pass your cell-door
do not speak.
I was first on the list, 
They may forget you tried to shield me
as the horsemen passed.
I saw the first pear
as it fell, 
the honey-seeking, golden-banded,
the yellow swarm
was not more fleet than I,
(spare us from loveliness)
and I fell prostrate
crying
you have flayed us
with your blossoms,
spare us the beauty
of fruit-trees.
The honey-seeking
paused not,
the air thundered their song,
and I alone was prostrate.
O rough-hewn
god of the orchard,
I bring you an offering, 
do you, alone unbeautiful,
son of the god,
spare us from loveliness
these fallen hazel-nuts,
stripped late of their green sheaths,
grapes, red-purple,
their berries
dripping with wine,
pomegranates already broken,
and shrunken figs
and quinces untouched,
I bring you as offering.
All Greece hates
the still eyes in the white face,
the lustre as of olives
where she stands,
and the white hands.
All Greece reviles
the wan face when she smiles,
hating it deeper still
when it grows wan and white,
remembering past enchantments
and past ills.
Greece sees, unmoved,
God's daughter, born of love,
the beauty of cool feet
and slenderest knees,
could love indeed the maid,
only if she were laid,
white ash amid funereal cypresses.
Whirl up, sea, 
Whirl your pointed pines.
Splash your great pines
On our rocks.
Hurl your green over us, 
Cover us with your pools of fir.
We two are left
I with small grace reveal
distaste and bitterness
you with small patience
take my hands
though effortless,
you scald their weight
as a bowl, lined with embers,
wherein droop
great petals of white rose,
forced by the heat
too soon to break.
We two are left
as a blank wall, the world,
earth and the men who talk,
saying their space of life
is good and gracious,
with eyes blank
as that blank surface
their ignorance mistakes
for final shelter
and a resting-place.
We two remain
yet by what miracle,
searching within the tangles of my brain,
I ask again,
have we two met within
this maze of dædal paths
in-wound mid grievous stone,
where once I stood alone?
