Like a gondola of green scented fruits	 
Drifting along the dank canals of Venice,	 
You, O exquisite one,	 
Have entered into my desolate city.	 
The blue smoke leaps	         
Like swirling clouds of birds vanishing.	 
So my love leaps forth toward you,	 
Vanishes and is renewed.	 
A rose-yellow moon in a pale sky	 
When the sunset is faint vermilion	  
In the mist among the tree-boughs	 
Art thou to me, my beloved.	 
A young beech tree on the edge of the forest	 
Stands still in the evening,	 
Yet shudders through all its leaves in the light air	  
And seems to fear the stars	 
So are you still and so tremble.
The red deer are high on the mountain,	 
They are beyond the last pine trees.	 
And my desires have run with them.	  
The flower which the wind has shaken	 
Is soon filled again with rain	 
So does my heart fill slowly with tears,	 
O Foam-Driver, Wind-of-the-Vineyards,	 
Until you return.
Why do you always stand there shivering
Between the white stream and the road?
The people pass through the dust
On bicycles, in carts, in motor-cars
The waggoners go by at dawn
The lovers walk on the grass path at night.
Stir from your roots, walk, poplar!
You are more beautiful than they are.
I know that the white wind loves you,
Is always kissing you and turning up
The white lining of your green petticoat.
The sky darts through you like blue rain,
And the grey rain drips on your flanks
And loves you.
And I have seen the moon
Slip his silver penny into your pocket
As you straightened your hair
And the white mist curling and hesitating
Like a bashful lover about your knees.
I know you, poplar
I have watched you since I was ten.
But if you had a little real love,
A little strength,
You would leave your nonchalant idle lovers
And go walking down the white road
Behind the waggoners.
There are beautiful beeches
Down beyond the hill.
Will you always stand there shivering?
One night I wandered alone from my comrades’ huts
The grasshoppers chirped softly
In the warm misty evening
Bracken fronds beckoned from the darkness
With exquisite frail green fingers
The tree gods muttered affectionately about me,
And from the distance came the grumble of a kindly train.
I was so happy to be alone,
So full of love for the great speechless earth,
That I could have laid my cheek in the wet grasses
And caressed with my lips the hard sinewy body
Of Earth, the cherishing mistress of bitter lovers.
They have torn the gold tettinx
From my hair
And wrenched the bronze sandals
From my ankles.
They have taken from me my friend
Who knew the holy wisdom of poets,
Who had drunk at the feast
Where Simonides sang.
No more do I walk the calm gardens
In the white mist of olives
No more do I take the rose-crown
From the white hands of a maiden.
I, who was free, am a slave
The Muses have forgotten me,
The gods do not hear me.
Here there are no flowers to love
But afar off I dream that I see
Bent poppies and the deathless asphodel.
This is an old and very cruel god
We will endure
We will try not to wince
When he crushed and rends us.
If indeed it is for your sakes,
If we perish or moan in torture,
Or stagger under sordid burdens
That you may live
Then we can endure.
If our wasted blood
Makes bright the page
Of poets yet to be
If this our tortured life
Save from destruction’s nails
Gold words of a Greek long dead
Then we can endure,
Then hope,
Then watch the sun rise
Without utter bitterness.
But, O thou old and very cruel god,
Take, if thou canst, this bitter cup from us.
I have been a spendthrift
Dropping from lazy fingers
Quiet coloured hours,
Fluttering away from me
Like oak and beech leaves in October.
I have lived keenly and wastefully,
Like a bush or a sun insect
Lived sensually and thoughtfully,
Loving the flesh and the beauty of this world
Green ivy about ruined towers,
The out-pouring of the grey sea,
And the ecstasy
Of a pale clear sky at sunset.
I have been prodigal of love
For cities and for lonely places
I have tried not to hate mankind
I have gathered sensations
Like ripe fruits in a rich orchard
All this is gone
There are no leaves, no sea,
No shade of a rich orchard,
Only a sterile, dusty waste,
Empty and threatening. 
I long vainly for solitude
And the lapse of silent hours
I am frantic to throw off
My heavy cloth and leather garments,
To set free my feet and body
And I am so far from beauty
That a yellow daisy seems to clutch my heart
With eager searching petals,
And I am grateful even to humility
For the taste of pure, clean bread. 
The grim dawn lightens thin bleak clouds
In the hill clefts beyond the flooded meadows
Lies death-pale, death-still mist.
We trudge along wearily,
Heavy with lack of sleep,
Spiritless, yet with pretence of gaiety.
The sun brings crimson to the colourless sky
Light gleams from brass and steel
We trudge on wearily
O God, end this bleak anguish
Soon, soon, with vivid crimson death,
End it in mist-pale sleep!
Through the dark pine trunks
Silver and yellow gleam the clouds
And the sun
The sea is faint purple.
My love, my love, I shall never reach you.
You are beautiful
As a straight red fox-glove
Among green plants
I stretched out my hand to caress you
It is blistered by the envious nettles.
I have spent hours this morning
Seeking in the brook
For a clear pebble
To remind me of your eyes.
And all the sleepless hours of night
I think of you.
Your kisses are poignant,
Ah! why must I leave you?
Here above I scribble and re-scribble
The words of a long-dead Greek Poet
“Love, thou art terrible,
Ah, Love, thou are bitter-sweet!”
Vagabonds of beauty,
Wistful exquisite waifs
From a lost, and a forgotten, and a lovely land,
We cannot comfort you
Though our souls yearn for you.
You are delicate strangers
In a gloomy town,
Stared at and hated
Gold crocus blossoms in a drab lane.
We cannot comfort you
Your life is anguish
All we can do
Mutely bring pungent herbs and branches of oak
And resinous scented pine wreaths
To hid the crown of thorny pain
Crushing your white frail foreheads.
I am a garden of red tulips
And late daffodils and bay-hedges,
A small sunk garden
About an oblong pool
With three grey lead Dutch tanks
I am this garden shattered and blown
With a day-long western gale
And bursts of rapid rain.
There are dank petals in the ruffled waters,
And muddy flowers upon the path.
The grass is covered with torn leaves.
God of gardens, dear small god of gardens,
Grant me faint glow of sunlight,
A last bird hopping in the quiet haze,
Then let the night swoop swiftly,
Fold round and crush out life
For ever.
Let the sea beat its thin torn hands
In anguish against the shore,
Let it moan
Between headland and cliff
Let the sea shriek out its agony
Across waste sands and marshes,
And clutch great ships,
Tearing them plate from steel plate
In reckless anger
Let it break the white bulwarks
Of harbour and city
Let it sob and scream and laugh
In a sharp fury,
With white salt tears
Wet on its writhen face
Ah! let the sea still be mad
And crash in madness among the shaking rocks
For the sea is the cry of our sorrow.
The long autumn grass beneath my body
Soaks my clothes in dew
Where my knees press into the ground
I can feel the damp earth.
In my nostrils is a smell of crushed grass,
Wet pine-cones and bark.
Through the bronze pine trunks
Glitters a silver segment of road.
Interminable squadrons of silver and grey horses
Pace in long ranks the blank fields of heaven.
There is no sound
The wind hisses gently through the pine-needles
The flutter of a finch’s wings about my head
Is violent as distant thunder,
And the shrill flight of a gnat
Sounds loud and clear.
I am “to fire at the enemy column
After it has passed”—
But my rifle (loaded with “blank”)
Lies untouched before me,
My spirit follows the gliding clouds
And my lips murmur of the mother of beauty
Standing breast-high in golden broom
Among the English pine-woods!
