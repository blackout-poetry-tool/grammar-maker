Once when I read the funnies
I took my little magnifying glass
and looked too close.
Forms became colors and colors
were just arrays of dots
and between the dots I saw the rough bleak
storyless legend of the pulp paper
empty as the winter moon
and I dreaded it.
I had looked right through,
when I wanted a universe
that sustains
looker and looking and the seen
forever, detail after detail
never ending. And all I had found
was between. But between
had its own song
Find it in the space between
it is just as empty as it seems
but this blankness is your mother.
Finding the measure is finding the mantram,
is finding the moon, as index of measure,
is finding the moon's source;
if that source
is Sun, finding the measure is finding
the natural articulation of ideas.
The organism
of the macrocosm, the organism of language,
the organism of I combine in ceaseless naturing
to propagate a fourth,
the poem, from their trinity.
Style is death. Finding the measure is finding
a freedom from that death, a way out, a movement
forward.
Finding the measure is finding the
specific music of the hour,
the synchronous
consequence of the motion of the whole world.
Long over, what's on the tree
shivers. Sky hides behind
white-faced, giving flesh to branch,
a red leaf
or yellow far enough away,
what Broch called ''the style
of old age," simplified
of images,
lean in the perfection of the bough,
naked & half-undone. Clouds break,
rain against a hidden sun,
the form plain
Science explains nothing
but holds all together as
many things as it can count
science is a basket
not a religion he said
a cat as big as a cat
the moon the size of the moon
science is the same as poetry
only it uses the wrong words.
